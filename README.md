## Business Problem

Our main objective is to analyze the relationships between the products in customer baskets and provide the most suitable product recommendations for customers in Germany during the years 2010-2011. In this case, the basket information of three different customers has been provided, and based on this basket data, we need to determine which products to recommend to make customers' shopping experiences more enjoyable. These recommendations will be derived using association rule analysis. In other words, by examining the products that customers purchase together, we will provide recommendations to similar shoppers. This is a data mining approach that can be used to enhance customer satisfaction and increase sales.

## Dataset

The Online Retail II dataset contains online sales transactions for a retail company based in the United Kingdom. It covers transactions from 01/12/2009 to 09/12/2011. The company's product catalog includes gift items, and it is worth noting that the majority of its customers are wholesalers. Here are some key details about the dataset:

- `InvoiceNo`: Invoice Number (Starting with 'C' indicates canceled transactions)
- `StockCode`: Product Code (Unique for each product)
- `Description`: Product Name
- `Quantity`: Quantity of Products (Number of items sold in invoices)
- `InvoiceDate`: Invoice Date
- `UnitPrice`: Invoice Price (in Sterling Pounds)

This dataset can be utilized for various analyses, predictions, and data mining projects.
